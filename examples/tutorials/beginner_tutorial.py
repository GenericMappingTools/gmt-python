# Tutorial setup
# --------------
#
# 1. This tutorial assumes that PyGMT has been properly installed. To confirm that it
# is working, ensure that the conda environment has been activated and
# run ``import pygmt`` in a Python console.
# 2. This tutorial assumes the use of a Python notebook, such as IPython or Jupyter
# Notebook. To see the figures while using a Python script instead,
# use ``fig.show(method="external")`` to display the figure in the default PDF viewer.
