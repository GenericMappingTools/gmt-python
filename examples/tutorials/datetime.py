Plotting Datetime Data
================

THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER WORK IN PROGRESS
Plotting vectors is handled by :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot`.

.. note::

    This tutorial assumes the use of a Python notebook, such as IPython or Jupyter Notebook.
    To see the figures while using a Python script instead, use
    ``fig.show(method="external")`` to display the figure in the default PDF viewer.

    To save the figure, use ``fig.savefig("figname.pdf")`` where ``"figname.pdf"``
    is the desired name and file extension for the saved figure.
